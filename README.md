# Introduction
The churn prediction project involves developing prediction models that allow determining which customers are more likely to leave a business or service. To do this, different metrics of prediction models will be compared to determine which one is the most effective in predicting churn. The ultimate goal is to help companies retain their customers and improve profitability.

 ## Description
Churn, or the customer abandonment rate, is a constant challenge for companies in all sectors. The loss of customers can have a significant impact on long-term revenue and profitability. In this project, the problem of churn is addressed using machine learning techniques to predict which customers are more likely to leave. Different models are explored and their accuracy and ability to identify key factors that influence a customer's decision to leave are evaluated. The ultimate goal is to provide companies with an effective tool to reduce their churn rate and improve customer retention.
